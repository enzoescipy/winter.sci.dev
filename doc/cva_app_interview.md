# Coffee Value Assessment App Development Journey: An Interview

## Introduction
The journey of developing the Coffee Value Assessment (CVA) application began not with a business plan, but with a personal connection to coffee culture and a desire to bridge the gap between scientific precision and sensory evaluation.

## Origins and Inspiration
- Started with regular attendance at coffee cuppings with a supportive coffee shop owner
- Observed experts discussing purchase decisions and detailed flavor aspects
- Motivated by desire to participate meaningfully in expert discussions
- Influenced by SCA's new CVA (Coffee Value Assessment) system
- Connected to personal background running Wintergreen Lab coffee science channel

## Technical Evolution
### Initial Version
- Basic features focusing on CVA protocol implementation:
  - Intensity checking
  - Checkbox checking
  - Affective pointing
  - Simple statistics
  - Timeline rewinding

### Current Version
- Enhanced features based on user needs:
  - Colorful note dictionary section
  - Detailed flavor note-taking capabilities
  - "Reason why this score" documentation
  - Sub-hedonic system supporting main scores
  - Comprehensive data management

## Key Innovation: The Sub-Hedonic System
Developed to address the crucial "Why?" behind scoring decisions:
- Transforms subjective experiences into structured dialogue
- Helps answer questions like "Why not a 9?"
- Provides framework for reasonable, comparable contexts
- Bridges gap between cupper's experience and producer's need for feedback

### Components of the Sub-Hedonic System
1. Secondary Scoring Layer
   - Supports main 9-point hedonic scores with detailed sub-scores
   - Allows cuppers to break down overall impressions into specific attributes
   - Creates a hierarchy of evaluation that supports the main score

2. Just-About-Right (JAR) Scale Integration
   - Enables assessment of whether attributes are at optimal levels
   - Helps identify if characteristics are too strong, too weak, or "just right"
   - Provides objective framework for subjective impressions

3. Detailed Flavor Note System
   - Colorful note dictionary for precise flavor identification
   - Organized categorization of taste and aroma attributes
   - Allows for building complex flavor profiles systematically

4. Contextual Commentary
   - Structured fields for explaining scoring decisions
   - Links between sub-scores and specific observations
   - Facilitates clear communication between cuppers and producers

### Implementation Benefits
- Reduces subjectivity in evaluation process
- Creates standardized language for quality discussions
- Maintains scientific rigor while improving accessibility
- Enables data-driven quality improvement conversations

## Current Challenges
- Expert users already have established methods
- New students find the system complex
- Industry professionals (like brewing champions) may not be familiar with CVA
- Balance between sophistication and accessibility

## Personal Reflections
- First published project after many unpublished ones
- Learning to handle user expectations and feedback
- Balancing project responsibilities with personal well-being
- Wrestling with questions about project direction and scope

## Technical Implementation
The app implements sophisticated interfaces including:
- KeyValuePairTableInterface for structured data management
- SubHedonicInterface for detailed scoring justification
- FlavorCATAInterface for comprehensive flavor analysis
- Integration with SCA's CVA standards while extending functionality

## Future Considerations
- Potential for different user experience levels
- Balance between scientific rigor and practical usability
- Questions about project scope and direction
- Focus on core user needs versus feature expansion

## About the Developer
The developer approaches this project from a unique perspective:
- Runs Wintergreen Lab (coffee science communication channel)
- Background in scientific approach to coffee
- Personal experience with the challenges of sensory analysis
- Commitment to bridging scientific precision with practical usability
