# From Cupping to Coding: The Journey of Building a Coffee Value Assessment App

:::note[About the Project]
The Coffee Value Assessment app is a Flutter-based application that implements and extends the SCA's CVA protocol, providing a structured approach to coffee evaluation while maintaining the nuanced art of coffee tasting.
:::

## The Genesis of an Idea

<Card title="Personal Connection">
  What started as regular attendance at coffee cuppings with a supportive coffee shop owner evolved into a mission to bridge the gap between scientific evaluation and sensory experience. The developer, running the [Wintergreen Lab](https://www.instagram.com/wintergreen_lab/) coffee science channel, found themselves at the intersection of scientific precision and practical coffee evaluation.

## Technical Evolution

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Initial Version">
    ```dart
    // Basic CVA protocol implementation
    - Intensity checking
    - Checkbox checking
    - Affective pointing
    - Simple statistics
    - Timeline rewinding
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Current Version">
    ```dart
    // Enhanced user-focused features
    - Colorful note dictionary
    - Detailed flavor profiles
    - "Reason why" documentation
    - Sub-hedonic system
    - Comprehensive data management
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## The Sub-Hedonic System: A Deep Dive

:::tip[Key Innovation]
The Sub-Hedonic System transforms subjective coffee experiences into structured, meaningful dialogue between cuppers and producers.
:::

### System Components

1. **Secondary Scoring Layer** <Icon name="star" />
   - Hierarchical evaluation structure
   - Detailed attribute breakdown
   - Support for main scoring decisions

2. **Just-About-Right (JAR) Scale** <Icon name="setting" />
   - Optimal level assessment
   - Three-point evaluation system
   - Objective framework for subjective impressions

3. **Flavor Note System** <Icon name="list" />
   - Colorful, intuitive interface
   - Organized taste categorization
   - Systematic profile building

4. **Contextual Commentary** <Icon name="document" />
   - Structured feedback system
   - Clear communication channels
   - Data-driven discussions

## Development Challenges and Growth

<Card title="Learning Through Publishing">
  This project represents more than just code - it's a story of personal growth, facing challenges, and learning to balance technical ambition with practical usability. As the developer's first published project, it brought valuable lessons about user expectations and project responsibility.
</Card>

## Looking Forward

:::caution[Future Considerations]
The project stands at a crossroads, balancing:
- Scientific rigor vs. practical usability
- Expert needs vs. beginner accessibility
- Feature expansion vs. core functionality
:::

## Technical Implementation Highlights

```dart
// Example of the Sub-Hedonic Interface
class SubHedonicInterface {
  final _subHedonicRxVO = SubHedonicRxVO();
  final _jarRxVO = JustAboutRightRxVO();
  final _noteRxVO = NoteAffecRxVO();
  
  // Implementation details...
}
```
